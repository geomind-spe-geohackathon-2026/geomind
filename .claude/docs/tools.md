# Tools

The primitive actions of an agent, in `geomind/tools/`. Tool names are stable identifiers: a change
is a new version.

## Tool

`Tool(name, description, input_schema, function, *, effect, idempotent=True, timeout=None,
max_retries=2, input_model=None)`. `@gd.tool(effect=...)` builds one from a typed function: the
schema comes from the signature through Pydantic and the description from the docstring.

| `effect` | Means | Runs in ask mode |
|---|---|---|
| `read` | reads, changes nothing | without asking |
| `compute` | calculates, changes nothing | without asking |
| `write` | writes inside the run | after approval |
| `execute` | runs sandbox code | after approval |
| `external` | network or anything outside the run | after approval |

`idempotent` says a call may run again after a crash. `is_pure` (`read` or `compute`) says a call
may run beside others and again in a replay. `reruns_in_replay` says a tool that is not pure runs
again in a replay too, because all it changes is the run's own log. `Tool` is shaped like a protocol, so toolsets from
other sources (MCP later) fit: without `input_model`, only the required and known names of
`input_schema` are checked. An agent names a tool by its attribute, on its own copy.

## Dispatch

`await dispatch(tool, call, context)` is one of the two places with side effects. It validates the input,
runs the function with the tool's timeout, times it and returns a `ToolResult`, or the `Request` or
`Finish` the tool returned. A sync function runs in a worker thread.

A function that needs the run declares a first parameter named `context`, and `dispatch` passes it:
`context.session` is the session of the run. The schema never shows it, and plain tools stay plain
functions.

- A validation error, an `gd.errors` or `gemini.errors` class, or a timeout becomes a result
  `{error: {class, message}}` with `is_error`, so the model can fix its call. gemini errors are
  recognised by module path, so `import geomind` need not import gemini.
- After `max_retries` validation failures of one tool in a row, the engine stops the run with
  `stop_reason="error"`.
- Any other exception is a bug: it is reported through `on_error`, and the model reads only
  `internal error`.
- A result over `tool_result_limit` is saved with `store.save_artifact` and returned as
  `{reference, summary}`. The key is a hash, so a call id from a model never becomes a path.
- A sync tool that times out keeps running in its thread until it returns; a thread cannot be
  stopped from outside.

## Built-ins

- `ask_user(question, options=None)` returns a `Request` of kind `question`; the engine pauses.
  `options` is a list of strings or of `{value, label}`, normalised to the latter. An answer to a
  question with options is `{"text": <value>}`, and any other text raises `RequestError`.
- `finish(answer)` ends the run, after `before_finish` hooks and output validation.

Both have effect `read`, so `ask` mode lets them through; `plan` mode runs neither.

## Problem state

`update_state(changes)` (`write`, not idempotent) applies JSON Patch operations to the problem state
and emits `state.changed`; see [context.md](context.md). An invalid patch is an error result that
says how to fix it. The default rule of [permissions.md](permissions.md) allows it in `ask` mode.

## Code tools

`run_python(code)` (`execute`, not idempotent), `write_file(path, text)` (`write`) and
`read_file(path)` (`execute`, since it needs the sandbox) act inside the run's sandbox. Without a
configured sandbox they return an error result saying so. A lost sandbox is an error result and the
next tool provisions a new one. See [sandbox.md](sandbox.md).

## Delegate

`Delegate(agent, max_summary_tokens=None)` runs the agent in a nested engine run through
`context.session`, with a clean context (the task text only), a child run id, its own sandbox and `parent` set on
every event. The model reads only the final answer, cut to the token limit at four characters per
token (default: the `delegate_summary_tokens` setting). The effect is `compute`, so delegating
needs no approval of its own: each nested tool is decided by the same permissions. It is not pure
and not idempotent: it runs alone, a replay reuses its recorded result, and after a crash it
becomes an error result. A pause in the nested run pauses the parent on the same request. Usage of
the nested run adds to the parent's.
